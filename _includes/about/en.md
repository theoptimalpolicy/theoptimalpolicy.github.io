> "A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying his vices. And it all comes from lying â€” to others and to yourself."

My name is Andrea Bonvini and I'm currently pursuing my MSc. in Biomedical Engineering @ Politecnico di Milano. My main interest are Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computational Neuroscience. During my academic years I wrote a series of notes which I'm going to share here as brief (notalwaysthecase) Blog-Posts in order to provide useful resources for the ML community, check them out! ;D
